    <h1> Geophysical survey definition</h1>
    <p>Geophysical survey is the surveying of the seabed to visualize, and understand the component of the seabed and it structure</p>

    <h1>Bathymetry Survey</h1>
    <p> It is the survey that help analyze the septh of the seabed from the water surface. It is also call depth survey. The equipment used for that is mainly single beam echosounder or multi beam echosounder. It uses the priciple of acoustic impedance by sending singnal and receiving the pulses</p>
